      <description>&lt;p&gt;Espresso is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/espresso-testing.html&#34;&gt;testing framework for Android&lt;/a&gt; that allows developers to write automated tests for their applications. The benefit of automated testing is that you can write a test plan, and simply hit run and have all of the important features in your app tested effortlessly, and arguably more consistent and thorough than manual testing. There is no doubt that it is a lot faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one of the lesser known development patterns for automated testing is the robot pattern, which makes writing tests much easier while providing a painless way to update tests whenever your app changes. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a deeper dive into what makes the robot pattern so powerful, and how to implement it in your next test suite.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
