      <description>&lt;p&gt;Third party libraries are a huge part of mobile app development. Popular tools like Retrofit, RxJava, Picasso, and many others prevent Android developers from reinventing the wheel everytime we need to do something over the network, asynchronously, or loading images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, developing and publishing these libraries can be intimidating to many people. I think this occurs for a number of reasons - worry about keeping up with maintenance, being outshined, or sometimes thinking no one would use your code. I have many thoughts on those ideas, but will save them for another blog post. In this one, we&amp;rsquo;ll just go over a step by step guide to creating and publishing a library to JCenter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
