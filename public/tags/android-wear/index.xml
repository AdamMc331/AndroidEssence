      <description>&lt;p&gt;User interface for Android Wear have all the same components as a phone&amp;rsquo;s UI, they just appear a little differently. In this post we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about Cards. You&amp;rsquo;ve most likely seen these in the Google now app, among other Material Design apps. Cards are great because they are a component that is able to provide a consistent look across multiple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will consider this post as a deeper dive into an &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/training/wearables/ui/cards.html&#34;&gt;existing tutorial&lt;/a&gt; in the Android docs, but as that one states the Cards discussed here are not the same as the Cards that appear as notifications on Android Wear. See the link to better understand this distinction. Let&amp;rsquo;s go over some of the relevant classes, and we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss their differences and how to implement them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rising in popularity after the latest Google I/O, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.android.com/wear/&#34;&gt;Android Wear&lt;/a&gt; is a game changer for mobile development. Wearable technology has brought benefits from a quicker access to information to a more accurate monitoring of our physical health. Developing for this platform allows you to tap into those features that are not as readily available on mobile handhelds as well as offer a more immersive experience of your product by making it available on wearable devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://developer.android.com/intl/pt-br/wear/index.html&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; will offer the most thorough insight into what is available, but Iâ€™d like to discuss how the UI development differs and how you can get started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
