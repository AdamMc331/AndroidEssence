      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of you who haven’t upgraded to Android Studio 1.4 yet, you may not have realized there is a new Navigation Drawer template in the New Project menu.

Modifying the Navigation View can be tricky if you don’t know where to look, and you may not understand why certain things are written as they are. This post is going to walk you through the process of creating your own Navigation View, and discussing some of the differences between this and the previous model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
