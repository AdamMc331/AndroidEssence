      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second post in what will be an ongoing series to demonstrate a few different architecture patterns that are used for Android development. You can find the code for each of them, often appearing before the blog posts, by following &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AdamMc331/todo-monorepo&#34;&gt;this repo&lt;/a&gt;. Give it a star!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-10-20-building-an-app-with-mvp.md %}) we discussed the MVP architecture for building an app. This time, we&amp;rsquo;re going to check out MVVM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re starting out with Android development, and even as an expert, you will hear about a lot of different architecture patterns. Anything from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model-View-Controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model-View-Presenter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model-View-ViewModel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model-View-Intent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be extremely hard to know which one to pick, what their differences are, and why they matter. I will tell you that even with my three years of Android experience at the point of writing this, I have trouble answering the first two questions. I can, however, explain why these architecture patterns matter - and it boils down to the idea of separation of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
