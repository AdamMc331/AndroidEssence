      <title>Five Essential Developer Experience Concepts For Android</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the most recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePpbpLyYI1w&#34;&gt;live stream&lt;/a&gt; for Tasks Of Affirmation, we looked at creating a good developer experience. It&amp;rsquo;s important to consider developers at the start of any new project, so we can ensure that over the lifetime of a project anyone who contributes can understand how to contribute, match any guidelines that a team has, and get up and running quickly. We also want to ensure that our codebase maintains a certain quality of formatting and a lack of code smells - and putting these checks in place before you even start prevents them from ever being introduced at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at five developer experience concepts I consider essential to every project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tasks Of Affirmation: A New Twitch Live Stream Series</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2021-09-02-toa-twitch-series/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the late summer of 2020, I began live streaming on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitch.com/adammc331&#34;&gt;my Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;. We started off by building an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/adammc331/AndroidStudyGuide&#34;&gt;Android Study Guide&lt;/a&gt; application. The purpose of the application was to build something people would be interested in using, while also taking the opportunity to build an application out in the open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a number of reasons, discussed in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Umvlpx-Wvg&#34;&gt;the latest video&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to sunset that project and begin a new live stream series: Tasks Of Affirmation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unit Testing Custom Lint Checks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-02-22-enforce-custom-views-with-lint.md %}) we looked at writing a custom lint check to enforce usages of a custom view instead of an Android framework implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll go over how to unit test such a scenario, and take the opportunity to look at some additional options of unit testing with lint as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Enforcing Custom View Usage With Android Lint</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2021-02-22-enforce-custom-views-with-lint/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2021-02-22-enforce-custom-views-with-lint/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes an Android project will have to implement a &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/custom-components&#34;&gt;custom view&lt;/a&gt; that is an extension of an existing Android view. We may do this for style purposes, or to implement additional logic, or any number of customization purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution brings a new problem for our codebase - how do we enforce that other developers use our custom view, instead of the Android framework view? We can solve this problem by writing our own &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/studio/write/lint&#34;&gt;Android lint&lt;/a&gt; check.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-02-01-storing-network-responses-with-apollo-http-cache.md %}) we looked at the HTTP cache from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/&#34;&gt;Apollo Android&lt;/a&gt; for storing network responses. In this post, we look at its counter part, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/essentials/normalized-cache/&#34;&gt;normalized cache&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Caching is the practice of storing data that we requested previously so we can serve it faster in the future. This creates a better user experience by decreasing loading times. It also has long term benefits like reducing the number of network requests, to save on phone resources or potentially provide offline support. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going to discuss how to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/essentials/http-cache/&#34;&gt;HTTP cache&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android&#34;&gt;Apollo Android SDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During a recent live stream on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/adammc331&#34;&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; channel, we explored three different solutions to dependency injection on Android. A do it yourself approach, Koin, and Dagger Hilt. Let&amp;rsquo;s revisit them side by side, and look at the nuances between them, so we can determine which solution we want to use in our own applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last post, we demonstrated the different types of [database relationships in Room]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-04-27-room-relationship-recap.md %}). Next, we&amp;rsquo;re going to explore another niched concept of Room database management: database migrations. A migration is a way to handle moving from one version of a database to another as users update your application from the play store.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, we&amp;rsquo;re going to explore some advanced concepts of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room&#34;&gt;Room Persistence Library&lt;/a&gt;. Room is a great tool for storing complex data for your Android applications inside a SQLite database. As you begin to store more data in your applications though, it can be difficult to determine how to organize all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to demistify database organization, and break down everything you need to know about database relationships in the Room library.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting Started With Test Driven Development</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-03-02-test-driven-development/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the many buzzwords thrown around the software devleopment community is Test Driven Development, or TDD. It is one of those phrases that sounds great when you say it - who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to have tests be their first priority when writing code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;rsquo;s not always clear what TDD means. Does it mean you write code with testability in mind? Does it mean writing tests first? How can we write tests if we don&amp;rsquo;t have code &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; test? This post will answer all of those questions, and teach you how to implement TDD effectively on Android.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2020-02-24-contributing-to-kotlin/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Kotlin language used by Android developers all over the world is open source and available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jetbrains/kotlin&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. This means it&amp;rsquo;s open for contributions from anyone! It may, of course, feel very intimidating to contribute to a project of that size. Especially for those of us who are new to open source contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JetBrains team makes this process a lot less scary than it sounds. There are some beginner friendly ways to contribute to the language, and this post will walk you through every step.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MVWTF&amp;#58; Demystifying Architecture Patterns</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-08-16-mvwtf/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As an Android developer, one of the questions I constantly see asked within the community is &amp;ldquo;what architecture pattern should I use?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discussion usually leads to a handful of buzzwordy acronyms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVVM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MVU?? (We don&amp;rsquo;t talk about this but apparently it&amp;rsquo;s the new kid on the block)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be really intimidating to new Android devs, as well as seasoned veterans who are constantly questioning if they&amp;rsquo;re using the right one. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re trying to decide which one to learn, or wondering if the one you already use is best for you, this post will help lead you to the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Repository Pattern&amp;#58; Properly Organizing Your Data Layer</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-05-20-repository-pattern/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-05-20-repository-pattern/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to properly architect your application is a concern we as developers constantly face. There&amp;rsquo;s unfortunately no one size fits all answer to it, and sometimes we don&amp;rsquo;t even know where to begin. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned along my Android journey that the answer can also vary depending on what portion of your app you&amp;rsquo;re trying to organize. Of course, you might say, &lt;a href=&#34;https://handstandsam.com/2019/03/10/it-depends-is-the-answer-to-your-android-question/&#34;&gt;it depends&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to your data layer, though, there are some really good tips on how to write clean, maintainable code. One of them is the Repository Pattern, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to provide a quick walk through of what it is and why it&amp;rsquo;s important.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unit Testing RxJava or Coroutine Code With Constructor Injection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Putting aside the long lasting debate right now about whether you should use RxJava or coroutines for your asynchronous code on Android, both camps often hit the same problem. How do I write unit tests for this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit testing asynchronous code is tricky, because we may need to know how to properly test callback APIs, or perhaps we just want things to run instantly and not worry about thread changes. We may also be wondering how to handle not having a &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; thread in a junit test, unlike a connected test. This post will be focusing on handling that last one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Showing A Fragment For A Result</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A number of developers preach a single activity architecture on Android, which is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to move forward to as well. In the process, though, I ran into one tricky problem. I don&amp;rsquo;t have something like &lt;code&gt;startActivityResult&lt;/code&gt; for fragments. If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar, &lt;code&gt;startActivityForResult&lt;/code&gt; is a method that allows you to launch an activity with a specific request code, and when that activity finishes, your first activity will get a callback in &lt;code&gt;onActivityResult&lt;/code&gt; and can do stuff with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is going to walk through how we can achieve that same affect using fragments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second post in what will be an ongoing series to demonstrate a few different architecture patterns that are used for Android development. You can find the code for each of them, often appearing before the blog posts, by following &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AdamMc331/todo-monorepo&#34;&gt;this repo&lt;/a&gt;. Give it a star!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-10-20-building-an-app-with-mvp.md %}) we discussed the MVP architecture for building an app. This time, we&amp;rsquo;re going to check out MVVM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Breaking the Buzzwords Barrier Part 3&amp;#58; ViewModel</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2018-06-01-breaking-the-buzzwords-barrier-viewmodel/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2018-06-01-breaking-the-buzzwords-barrier-viewmodel/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So far we&amp;rsquo;ve covered four big buzzwords used in our application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model-View-ViewModel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RxJava&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repository Pattern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we should circle back to the beginning. Following our diagram outlined in the [previous parts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-05-31-breaking-the-buzzwords-barrier-room-rx-repository.md %}), the next component we can begin to work on is our AccountViewModel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/buzzwords/architecture_viewmodel.png&#34; alt=&#34;Android Essence&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this may bring up some confusion. We already discussed ViewModels in [part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-05-30-breaking-the-buzzwords-barrier-mvvm.md %}). Well, depending on context, we may not be referring to the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In [part 1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-05-30-breaking-the-buzzwords-barrier-mvvm.md %}) we discussed how we were going to architect the various components of our application. Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to build them. To understand what we should build first, we should revisit the diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/buzzwords/cashcaretaker_mvvm.png&#34; alt=&#34;MVVM&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would start with three spots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb to remember this, is that these nodes don&amp;rsquo;t depend on anything else just yet (well, the repository depends on the database, but that was included). I can&amp;rsquo;t build my ViewModel until I have my repository, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with persistence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MVVM? Retrofit? RxJava? Data binding? Architecture components? LiveData? Kotlin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, these buzzwords are heard all over the Android community. Every podcast/blog/conference talk is referencing one of these. Which can be &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; intimidating to new developers. Which one should I learn first? Do I need all of them? What are these things even used for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this series is to break all of that down, and show that none of these buzzwords are truly that scary. We&amp;rsquo;ll go over an application I&amp;rsquo;ve published called &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidessence.cashcaretaker&#34;&gt;CashCaretaker&lt;/a&gt; which is a simple finance tracker with all data stored locally on the device. It uses all of the buzzwords I mentioned further up, and we can go through them step by step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can checkout a simple gif of the project here:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re starting out with Android development, and even as an expert, you will hear about a lot of different architecture patterns. Anything from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model-View-Controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model-View-Presenter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model-View-ViewModel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model-View-Intent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be extremely hard to know which one to pick, what their differences are, and why they matter. I will tell you that even with my three years of Android experience at the point of writing this, I have trouble answering the first two questions. I can, however, explain why these architecture patterns matter - and it boils down to the idea of separation of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Android released version 6.0 Marshmallow (yes, a little outdated at this point), a whole slew of new developer APIs came with it. One that I&amp;rsquo;ve personally enjoyed as a consumer is &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0.html#fingerprint-authentication&#34;&gt;fingerprint authentication&lt;/a&gt;. I skimmed over the official docs, and even through their &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/samples/FingerprintDialog/index.html&#34;&gt;Fingerprint Dialog Sample&lt;/a&gt; but had a difficult time following what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, though, I was able to recreate the flow. This post is going to be a step by step guide to integrating your own fingerprint dialog in your Android application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After two years of blogging on this site, posting various tutorials and Android discussions I felt were relevant, I&amp;rsquo;m now looking to share that experience with others. Blogging has been an invaluable experience for me, as I learn just as much as I get to teach when I&amp;rsquo;m thoroughly researching and writing a post. There&amp;rsquo;s no reason for me to keep this opportunity to myself, though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Developing And Publishing Android Libraries</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-10-19-developing-and-publishing-android-libraries/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Third party libraries are a huge part of mobile app development. Popular tools like Retrofit, RxJava, Picasso, and many others prevent Android developers from reinventing the wheel everytime we need to do something over the network, asynchronously, or loading images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, developing and publishing these libraries can be intimidating to many people. I think this occurs for a number of reasons - worry about keeping up with maintenance, being outshined, or sometimes thinking no one would use your code. I have many thoughts on those ideas, but will save them for another blog post. In this one, we&amp;rsquo;ll just go over a step by step guide to creating and publishing a library to JCenter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Controlling the brightness of your phone can be a hassle. Currently we&amp;rsquo;re stuck with the two step process - swipe down on the notification drawer, and then deal with the slider trying to get it just right. However, with the release of Android Oreo and a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/services.html#fingerprint&#34;&gt;fingerprint gesture API&lt;/a&gt;, a new solution was born. Enter &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tunjid.fingergestures&#34;&gt;DigiLux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Leveraging The Robot Pattern For Espresso Tests</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Espresso is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/espresso-testing.html&#34;&gt;testing framework for Android&lt;/a&gt; that allows developers to write automated tests for their applications. The benefit of automated testing is that you can write a test plan, and simply hit run and have all of the important features in your app tested effortlessly, and arguably more consistent and thorough than manual testing. There is no doubt that it is a lot faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one of the lesser known development patterns for automated testing is the robot pattern, which makes writing tests much easier while providing a painless way to update tests whenever your app changes. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a deeper dive into what makes the robot pattern so powerful, and how to implement it in your next test suite.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understanding Nullability In Kotlin</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-06-28-understanding-nullability-in-kotlin/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every Java programmer has faced the dreaded &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; at some point in their life. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s your fault, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a pesky race condition. Regardless, it&amp;rsquo;s a head ache and generally leads to a ton of &lt;code&gt;if (myVariable != null) { }&lt;/code&gt; conditions all over your code. However, the latest craze &lt;a href=&#34;https://kotlinlang.org&#34;&gt;Kotlin&lt;/a&gt; can help with that too. Kotlin introduced &lt;a href=&#34;https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html&#34;&gt;null safety&lt;/a&gt; into its type system, with the potential of removing all NPEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is both going to review the official docs linked above, as well as provide some common tips and tricks to work with the nullability - something that is new in this language for many Java programmers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year at Google I/O, the Android team announced &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html&#34;&gt;Android Architecture Components&lt;/a&gt; a combination of new, helpful libraries for Android development. One that particularly interested me was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html&#34;&gt;Room Persistence Library&lt;/a&gt;, which is an abstraction layer of SQLite designed to make database access and creation a lot easier. Right off the bat it reminded me of &lt;a href=&#34;https://realm.io/products/realm-mobile-database/&#34;&gt;Realm&lt;/a&gt;, which I learned about at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT7XD1hifkU&#34;&gt;Droidcon NYC&lt;/a&gt; and really admired, so I decided to dive in and build a todo list using Room &amp;amp; RxJava.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog post is going to discuss creating a project from scratch in Kotlin. We will build a sample Todo List application that will not be very complicated, but covers enough to show the benefits of Kotlin. Part 1 will discuss creating a new project and configuring Kotlin. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with that, copy the &lt;code&gt;MainActivity.kt&lt;/code&gt; code and skip to part 2 to begin building the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial assumes a basic knowledge of programming, and some familiarity with Android. If you have any questions please leave them in the comments, and I will udpate these posts with a deeper explanation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How To Build A Todo List In Kotlin Part 2&amp;#58; Implementing A RecyclerView</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-05-21-how-to-build-a-todo-list-in-kotlin-part-2-recyclerview/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2017-05-21-how-to-build-a-todo-list-in-kotlin-part-2-recyclerview/</guid>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following up on [part 2]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-05-21-how-to-build-a-todo-list-in-kotlin-part-1-new-project.md %}) which demonstrates how to create your Android app and configure Kotlin, we&amp;rsquo;ll begin building the heart and soul of a Todo List application - the list!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;data-model&#34;&gt;Data Model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s begin by defining our model. We&amp;rsquo;re going to create a simple class that has two fields, one for description and one for whether or not it&amp;rsquo;s completed. Here is how this class will look in Kotlin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-kotlin&#34; data-lang=&#34;kotlin&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;py&#34;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;py&#34;&gt;completed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Serializable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may not believe it, but that&amp;rsquo;s all we need. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what&amp;rsquo;s happening here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A data class is a special class in Kotlin that provides you with default behaviors for all your Object methods like &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;hashCode()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;equals()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;copy()&lt;/code&gt;. Read more &lt;a href=&#34;https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kotlin allows for default constructors to be defined right with the class name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kotlin allows for default parameters. So in this case, we have a constructor that can be used as &lt;code&gt;Task(&amp;quot;Description&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt; and it will default to incomplete, or we can call it with &lt;code&gt;Task(&amp;quot;Description&amp;quot;, true)&lt;/code&gt; to set the initial value of the completed boolean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve had our class implement Serializable. In this simple app, we&amp;rsquo;re just going to save the data to a text file instead of over complicating it with SQLite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following parts [1]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-05-21-how-to-build-a-todo-list-in-kotlin-part-1-new-project.md %}) and [2]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-05-21-how-to-build-a-todo-list-in-kotlin-part-2-recyclerview.md %}) you should have a working Android app in Kotlin that displays a list of Tasks to be completed and lets you mark them as complete. This segment is going to show you how to implement support for adding new items.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following along with parts 1-3, you now have an (almost) working todo list application. The only thing we are missing is persisting the data. Running your Android app now and rotating your screen will show you that the items you add won&amp;rsquo;t persist, and disappear anytime an activity is killed and recreated. This post will show you how to write the list to a text file and read from it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
